Frescol
=======

It's a toy language, product of my final project for compilers classes at my CS
graduation. The name comes from the words "fresco", wich refers to my tendency
to invent unnecessary stuff just to satisfy the "desires" of my crazy mind, and
Algol, one of the most notorious and influential Programming Languages (PL).
